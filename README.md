# Alien-Invasion

This is a project based on Python Crash Courses 2nd Edition, by Eric Matthes, named "Alien Invasion".
I added an SQLite DB to store the high scores so that you they won't be erased when closing the app.

Current project (05.21) works fines, despite being messy (newbee here) but it still need to be fixed in one points, at least:
High-score is not updating when starting a second run, but it is correctly updated when re-launching the app.

- File named "Test2" is actually the class for the input box to add your name in case you did an high-score. The graphic has to be revised, but it works.

- Folder "Images" contains also the font file
